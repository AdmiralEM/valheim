![Demo](https://i.postimg.cc/C1JKgzF5/succ.gif)

Are you tired of rummaging through chests to find that one missing ingredient that you know is somewhere? Tired of having to split stacks, craft and then put it all back again? 

Say no more!

With this mod when you are crafting, building or fueling up, it will not only use your inventory, but also containers within your range.  

[Jump to changelog by clicking here](#changelog)

#### What containers are checked?
- within a configurable range
- accessible by the player using the mod
- created by a player (generated chests are ignored)
- cart and ship containers (configurable)
    - (!) there are still some issues with networking that are being worked on  
      
## Manual installation

Drop the `.dll` into `<GameLocation>\BepInEx\plugins`

## Encountered an issue?

Please create an issue in the GitHub repo here:

https://github.com/abearcodes/Valheim/issues
 
## Configuration

The plugin supports multiple ways of configuring it's behaviour. For specific details on how to set them, please check the config file via R2Modman or manually under 

`BepInEx/config/com.github.abearcodes.valheim.craftingwithcontainers.cfg` 

The list below only highlights settings with major impact. 

#### General settings

- **ContainerLookupRange**

    Range in which the mod searches for containers. Base range is equal to the range of the crafting table (20). Will not take from containers that are not currently loaded into memory, so setting this value to big numbers might not yield the expected result.

- **TakeFromPlayerInventoryFirst**
    
    Whether or not the mod should try to take from the player inventory first. Do note that Kilns and Furnaces will always check your inventory first.  

- **AddExtractionEffectWhenCrafting**
  
    _Enabled by default_  

    If enabled, when removing items from containers an fading line effect will appear from affected containers (see demo screenshot).

- **LogItemRemovalsToConsole**

    If enabled, item removal requests will be logged to the ingame console (accessible via F5).

#### Interactions settings

- **AllowTakeFuelForKilnAndFurnace** and **AllowTakeFuelForFireplace**

    If enabled, will allow the mod to take fuel from nearby containers when using fuels & kilns or fireplaces accordingly. 
 
#### Filtering settings  
 
- **ShouldFilterByContainerPieceNames** and **AllowedContainerLookupPieceNames**
 
    These settings allows you to enable and filter the containers that are checked.
    For example, you might want to exclude ships, carts or personal chests.
    
    The value for this setting is a comma separated list of identifiers.     
     
    By default it's disabled and all containers are considered when crafting. 

## Compatibility

This list will mainly contains mods that somehow influence your crafting, building or storing experience. Compatibility is a flimsy subject as mods develop and change, so the compatibility list below is based on the latest release of the mods affected and the stated version of this mod. You can deduct the date based on the releases on Thunderstore if needed.

The entries in this list are partially gathered by me, but mainly by other players that have tested the mods together and reported back.

_*for brevity, CwC stands for CraftingWithContainers further on_

**Compatible**:

- Valheim Plus (tested on 1.0.6). CwC disables the conflicting Valheim patch. 
- Quick Deposit (tested on 1.0.6)

**Conflicting**:

- ImprovedBuildHud (tested on 1.0.6)
    - CwC will completely override the changes to the requirements list that ImprovedBuildHud provides. So while nothing will break, it pretty much disables ImprovedBuildHud. CwC does have it's own indicator of how many resources are available for crafting and building, but it won't show you how how many items can be built. Want it as a feature? Create a ticket on GitHub!
  
- Other mods that completely take control over the crafting UI or functions 

# Changelog

### 1.0.14

- revert to old networking fix, new implementation requires all clients and server to have the mod installed 
- smelters and kilns should now take fuel properly from the players inventory
- using a hoe no longer error-spams 
- workaround for Equipment&QuickSlots 2.0.0+. Crafting With Containers will now check if Equipment&QuickSlots patched the inventory and if yes, it will avoid removing the items itself and let E&QS take care of it. Not really a fix. Just a quick workaround with the time I have at hand.
- (!) no longer supports taking items from containers first, always takes from inventory 

### 1.0.13

- fixes dupe glitch when using carts/ships/etc
- smelters and kilns now have separate filter lists
- build hud now shows max amount of buildables

### 1.0.12

- fixes an issue that breaks crafting

### 1.0.11

- fixed total amount of resources not showing when not using any other overriding mods :)

### 1.0.10

- fixed graphical item "attract" effect not spawning at the right position
- added a filter for which fuel to use when using Kilns (Smelters always use coal)
- no more transpiler patching 
    - should improve compatibility with other mods, tested: Epic Loot, Multicraft
    - while it feels "right" not to copy-paste code from the game to get similar functionality, it's really hard to get things working with other mods that completely reroute functionality. Compatibility patches also become a major pain.

### 1.0.9

- fixed a bug where too many items would be removed if player inventory was checked first

### 1.0.8

- fix Kilns and Furnaces not taking items from containers. No longer requires restart to enable/disable.
- fix plugin error reporter logging errors when using resources from the player inventory even though everything was working properly
- items are now taken

### v1.0.7

- temp fix for boat/cart duping. Now requires the player to be the user of it for the container to be considered viable. "Driving" the cart or boats or interacting with the container will be considered "using" it.  

### v1.0.6

- fix Nullreference exception when Valheim plus is not present 

### v1.0.5

- compatibility fix for crafting requirements indicator 
    - reverts a patch introduced by ValheimPlus and ImprovedBuildHud on `InventoryGui.SetupRequirement` that would break the crafting requirements indicator. 

### v1.0.4

Big changes! Pretty much a rewrite!

- _**no longer requires a crafting station**_
- _**now supports building too!**_
- _**no longer patches Inventory methods directly.**_
    - instead it reroutes required calls to Inventory to a static class.
    - this should help with mod compatibility as the initial methods are untouched. This will cause mods not to use the "CraftingFromContainers" functionality, but both mods should work properly.   
- toggleable Smelter, Kiln and Fireplace fuel consumption from nearby containers
- added indicator to how many resources of a type the player has

- swapped previous "crafting station extension" effect for a "sucking" effect when the crafting actually takes place
- option to take resources from player inventory first removed
- option to log crafting events to Console window (via `F5`)

## 1.0.3
  
 - partial multiplayer workaround for containers not updating. Does not fix: ships, moving carts,
 dragging resources at the last possible second.    
 
## 1.0.2
 
 - fixed a bug of not removing items when the amount of items is the exact
 one needed.
 
 - Fixed a bug where tracker would attempt to remove effects from non existing entries 
 
## 1.0.1
 
 - changed GitHub URL in README
 
## 1.0.0 
 
 - Initial release
