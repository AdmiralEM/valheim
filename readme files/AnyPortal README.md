# Description

Disables tag-based portal pairing and instead provides a drop-down box for you to choose which destination portal you want to connect to.

## Destination selection
When you interact with a portal, you'll see a new dropdown under the tag input text box. Click on the dropdown and select your desired destination. The list elements include the tag name of the destination portals and their distances from the player.

## Show destination on map
Don't recognize a portal listed in the dropdown? Just select it and click the "Map" button to be shown where the portal is on the map.


# Installation (Read carefully!!!)

1. Install [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)
2. Copy AnyPortal.dll to the BepInEx plugins directory (Valheim/BepInEx/plugins/)

**If you want to use this in multiplayer, you also need to install the mod on the server.** If you notice that you are able to select portals from the dropdown, but they connect and disconnect a few seconds later, that most likely means the mod isn't running on the server.



## Building from source
Open the Unity project in AnyPortalUnity, open the "Assets" tab, and click "Build AssetBundles". Then open the C# project with Visual Studio to build the dll.
