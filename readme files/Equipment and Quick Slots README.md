# !! READ ME FIRST BEFORE UPGRADING !!
The new, v2.0 of Equipment and Quick Slots uses a new system for saving and loading under the hood.

It is NOT compatible with 1.x versions and 1.x must be uninstalled correctly before upgrading to the 2.0 version!

### How to Upgrade Equipment and Quick Slots 1.x to 2.0.X
1. Start the game with the old mod installed
2. Find a safe place for your character
3. Unequip all equipment and move everything out of the quick slots
4. Quit the game using the menu
5. Remove the old Equipment and Quick Slots dll and install the new version
6. Run the game again
7. You should see your new empty slots in the inventory and be able to re-equip your items
